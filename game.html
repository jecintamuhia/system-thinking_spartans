        <h2>Player turn</h2>
        <p>We have four players who will play in turns.
Players roll a dice to determine order of play and the species to take.
Player one rolls a dice to determine the number of steps he would move,Then player two takes over ,this is done until all  four players move.
</p>
<h2>Collect Resources</h2>
<p>As the players maneuver throughout the forest, if they land on a space with resource tokens, they collect them.</p>
<h2>Draw event cards</h2>
<p>If they land on an event space they draw an event card and read it aloud. This may trigger a survival challenge or an opportunity.</p>
<h2>SURVIVAL CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>Once an event card is drawn(announced) players must assess how their species adapt the new conditions by:
Players have to use the resources that they have collected in order to adapt  to the changes.

Players might form temporary alliances, share resources or collaborate against a common threat.
